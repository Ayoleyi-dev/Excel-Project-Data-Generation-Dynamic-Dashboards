# Excel Project: Data Generation & Dynamic Dashboards

This project demonstrates two key Excel skills:
1.  Generating a realistic, synthetic dataset from scratch.
2.  Building a dynamic dashboard that automatically updates when new data is added.

## Project Process

1.  **Data Generation:** I created a 200-row sales report for a fake electronics store. I used functions like `=RANDBETWEEN()`, `=CHOOSE()`, and `=DATE()` to randomly populate fields for `Date`, `Product`, `Region`, and `Units Sold`.
2.  **Analysis:** I used Pivot Tables to analyze the data.
3.  **Dashboard:** I built a dashboard based on an Excel Table, ensuring all charts and pivots update by simply clicking "Refresh All" when new data rows are added to the table.

## Key Insights from the (Fake) Data

* **Top Product:** [CPU'S]
* **Top Region:** [WEST]

## Tools Used

* Microsoft Excel
* Excel Functions (`RANDBETWEEN`, `CHOOSE`)
* Excel Tables (for dynamic ranges)
* Pivot Tables & PivotCharts
* Dynamic Dashboards ("Refresh All" feature)
